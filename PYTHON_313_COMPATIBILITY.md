# Python 3.13 Compatibility Update

## Changes Made

This project has been updated for Python 3.13 compatibility with the following improvements:

### 1. Dependencies Updated
- Updated `pyproject.toml` to support Python 3.9 through 3.13
- Updated dependencies to their latest compatible versions:
  - `rich` from ^12.5.1 to ^13.7.0
  - `typer` from ^0.6.1 to ^0.12.0
  - `pylint` from ^2.13 to ^3.0
  - `pytest` from ^7.1.2 to ^8.0
  - Added `black` and `mypy` for better code quality

### 2. Security Improvements
- Replaced all `os.system()` calls with safer `subprocess.run()` 
- Added proper shell command escaping using `shlex.quote()`
- Improved error handling throughout all functions
- Added type hints for better code safety

### 3. Code Quality Improvements
- Added proper return type annotations
- Improved error handling and return values
- Used `pathlib.Path` for safer file operations
- Removed code duplication
- Better string formatting consistency

### 4. Functional Changes
- All scan functions now return boolean success/failure status
- Better error reporting and logging
- Safer directory creation using `Path.mkdir()`
- Environment variable handling improved for API keys

## Testing Python 3.13 Compatibility

To test with Python 3.13:

1. Install Python 3.13
2. Update poetry dependencies: `poetry update`
3. Run tests: `poetry run pytest`
4. Check with linting: `poetry run pylint assessment_toolkit/`

## Breaking Changes

- All scan functions now return `bool` instead of `None`
- Some functions may behave slightly differently due to improved error handling
- Command execution is now more secure but may require updated shell commands

## Migration Guide

If you have custom code calling these functions:

```python
# Before
discovery(rv_num, target_list)

# After - check return value
if discovery(rv_num, target_list):
    print("Discovery scan completed successfully")
else:
    print("Discovery scan failed")
```
