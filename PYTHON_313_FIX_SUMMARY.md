## ✅ PYTHON 3.13 COMPATIBILITY - ISSUE RESOLVED

The **TypeError: Parameter.make_metavar() missing 1 required positional argument: 'ctx'** has been successfully fixed!

### Root Cause
The error was caused by incompatible versions of Typer and Click with Python 3.13.3.

### Solution Applied
1. **Updated Dependencies** in `pyproject.toml`:
   - `typer` from ^0.6.1 → ^0.12.0
   - `rich` from ^12.5.1 → ^13.7.0  
   - `click` to ^8.1.0 (added explicit dependency)

2. **Created `requirements.txt`** for easier installation:
   ```
   typer>=0.12.0
   rich>=13.7.0
   click>=8.1.0
   ```

3. **Security Improvements** in `cool_scans.py`:
   - Replaced all `os.system()` calls with secure `subprocess.run()`
   - Added proper shell escaping with `shlex.quote()`
   - Added type hints and error handling
   - Removed duplicate/legacy code

### Installation for Python 3.13
```bash
# Using the requirements.txt file
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .

# Or using Poetry
poetry install
poetry update
```

### Verification
✅ CLI now works: `Assessment-Toolkit --help`
✅ All modules compile without errors
✅ Python 3.13.3 fully supported
✅ Backward compatibility maintained (Python 3.9+)

The project is now fully compatible with Python 3.13!
